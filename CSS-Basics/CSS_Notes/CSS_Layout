Layout

    When first creating your website, its best to create an initial concept by blocking out your layout. for me its comparable to making a composition in relation to making your painting, start with the large areas first then work your way to the smaller sections, much like painting a picture start with the large objects then break them down into there smaller areas by blocking out what secions you should paint first before getting into the final details. Ive also noted that it helps with making my HTML content by seeing what kindof code i need to make first then breaking it down further and further to get the areas that id like to have and creating a flowchart for me to follow. css is very much the same in that regards. ex large box with headers and information it. then the column, the column has multiple tags or icons etc. but breaking them down via HTML and CSS first and then flowing with it makes it wayyy simpler to do instead of just rushing at it and trying to figure out what to do next much more effiecent way to go about things.
