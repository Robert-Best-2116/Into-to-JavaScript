CSS Basics



Selecting an element 

EX: selecting h1 tags and all paragraphs

h1 {color: red;}


p {text-align: center;}
-Note this will select all paragraphs to be centered as there is no class


Selecting A Class inside of an Element 

EX: showing how to center text in a paragrah as well as change the text of one spesific line of code, 
    to do so use the . before the class name

HTML Code
<p class="is-centered">This text should be center aligned</p>
<p>This text should remain left-aligned</p>
<p class="is-red">This text should be red</p>

CSS Code

.is-centered {text-align: center;}

.is-red {color: red;}




Selecting an :indeterminate

ex: 
-Note only use one id as it is extreemly spesific and will only work on the first id found with that name

HTML code

Use the id="name your going to use" inside of the element 

CSS code

use the # followed by the name of the id tag




Advanced Selectors

The Wildcard *
    Selects all of the elements 

    Ex: selecing all of the outlines of ever element on the page 
    * {outline: 1px solid red;}

    it would cause all of the outlines on the entire page to become red 



Selecting Elements inside of another Element 

    EX-In this code we are going to select the paragraph (p) inside of the class quote, and change the color and font. 
    we do this in css by usuing the .name of the class, and following it with the element we would like to select inside of the class so p 

    HTML Code Example
                <p>This is a quote about CSS</p>
            <div class="quote">
                <p>"CSS is like chess. You learn the basics in a day and spend a lifetime mastering it."</p>
            </div>
            <p>Chris Coyier (css-tricks.com)</p>


                CSS Code Example
                .quote p {color: darkslategrey; font-style: italic;}




                Direct Descendant Selector >
                    Selects only the element directley below the element but not other children elements, 

                    HTML Code Example 
                    <div class="header">
                <img src="brand-img.png" alt="brand image">
                <a href="#">Home</a>
                <a href="#">About</a>
                <a href="#" class="cart">
                    <img src="cart.png" alt="cart-icon">
                    <span>Cart (2)</span>
                </a>
            </div>


            Css Code Example
            .header > img {height: 50px;}

        the > will only select the image but not anything else inside of the class of header. including the other image, which has the same element tag. 





The Attrubute Selector [  ]

    This is used for styling to similar elelemts that rely upon the same attrutubte for how they behave.

        Example- if we are going to change the styling of two elements that both make use of the imput tag, without usuing classes

    
        HTML code example 

                <form action="/process" method="post">
                <input type="text" name="username" value="Rebecca">
                <input type="submit" value="Enter Username">
            </form>
    

        CSS Code Example

                input {padding: 5px;border-color: rebeccapurple;}

                input[type="text"] {border: none;border-bottom: 2px solid rebeccapurple;}

                input[type="submit"] {color: white;background-color: rebeccapurple;}
                

    By usuing the [ ] we have selected the spesific elements inside of a tag by name my assumption is that it would select every single input type="text" and input type="submit"
